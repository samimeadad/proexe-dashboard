# Proexe Dashboard Task

[Link to the official website](https://proexe-dashboard.netlify.app)

- React JS has been used as the front-end JavaScript Library.

- React Router version 5 has been used to implement SPA functionality.

-  UI/Visual Side is built on React-Bootstrap.

- Form functionality is implemented by React-Hook-Form.

- All database operation (CRUD) is based on browser local storage.

-  I have gone through the functionality (CRUD operation) document provided by the JSON placeholder, According to this document, all the CRUD operation code is fake. So, I just place the necessary code for CRUD operation in the database and comment on them.

- 6. No Context API, Redux, or useReducer hook has been used. The React State functionality is not so complicated in this case. So I avoided unnecessary coding.

- I have made my GitHub Repository public. Hope this won't any problem from your end.
